# Extruder
Extruder is a remake of the arcade game Magical Drop II, for the 8 bit micro computer Sinclair ZX Spectrum 48k

It uses the pasmo assembler.

To compile, requires 2 steps
- execute compileData.bat to generate the graphics data files
- execute the compile.bat to generate the final assembly with code and graphics data

# NOTE:
This code uses the BeepFX player by Shiru.

This is still a work in progress, although the game is already playable.
